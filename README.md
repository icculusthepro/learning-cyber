1. Download and configure Kali Linux VM. 12/26/2023
- I have done this many times before but never really pursued any red teaming activites. My goals are to learn more about in depth cybersecurity topics specifically red teaming..
- I have a homelab setup, utilizing this will allow me to work from the KALI VM from any PC on my home network. 

2. Watched various Youtube videos about the MITRE Att&ck Framework.
-  Although I posses knowledge of many of the topics of cybersecurity techniques and tactics at a high level the MITRE Att&ck framework is a valuable asset for mapping attacks post discovery or planning attacks I do not have an in depth knowledge of the framework itself and will attempt to learn it by performing simulated red team activities. Here is a good blog post I saw on reddit that explains how it can be used. https://blog.gravitywall.net/2022/06/16/incorporating-mitre-attck-in-your-security-operations/

3. Began this course on Youtube - Ethical Hacking in 15 Hours - 2023 Edition - Learn to Hack!
- I have started this before but never gotten very far.

4. Downloaded my Office Apps to my main PC. Utilizing OneNote for centralized notetaking that I can access from anywhere. I regularly use two computers, my main system and my laptop.
