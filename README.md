# Learning Cyber
Until I set up a blog or professional website for myself I will be utilizing this repo to document my cyber security learning

# Goals
1. Develop more specialized knowledge on topics of cybersecurity. 
2. Complete TryHackMe Rooms

1. Download and configure Kali Linux VM. 12/26/2023
- I have done this many times before but never really pursued any red teaming activites. My goals are to learn more about in depth cybersecurity topics specifically red teaming..

2. Watched various Youtube videos about the MITRE Att&ck Framework.
-  Although I posses knowledge of many of the topics of cybersecurity techniques and tactics at a high level the MITRE Att&ck framework is a valuable asset for mapping attacks post discovery or planning attacks I do not have an in depth knowledge of the framework itself and will attempt to learn it by performing simulated red team activities. Here is a good blog post I saw on reddit that explains how it can be used. https://blog.gravitywall.net/2022/06/16/incorporating-mitre-attck-in-your-security-operations/
